Well yeah, I think that comes across.
There's nothing wrong with it...
uhh...
Grace...!

##3
Yeah, this is a huge couch...
It's a nice choice.
Everybody always comments on Grace's sculptures.
There's nothing wrong with them...
Yeah everyone notices it when they come in.
Oh, Grace...  
Grace tells me she was the highest bidder at an auction for it.
Yeah, it really makes you feel like you've made it.
There's nothing you can say wrong about this...
It's nice.
See, Grace, no one has a problem with your decorating, it's fine!
See Grace, no one is complaining about your decorating, there's nothing wrong with it!
Oh Grace...
Somehow I knew you'd say that.
Well this painting is a great investment, I'm sure.
What are you talking about?  
But I still think this looks fine... 
No, but I'm just trying to be honest --
See, Grace, no one has a problem with your decorating.
See, Grace, you're the only one unhappy with your decorating.
Grace, sweetheart, your decorating is fine, okay?  Besides this painting is a great investment, I'm sure.
Well, it's impressive... even after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace somehow finds time to decorate... 
Well, it's impressive... even aft
ter a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace somehow finds time to decorate... 
Well wait a minute! I don't think you've taken a close look yet.  Let it soak in a little!
See, I told you he would like it!  There's nothing wrong with it.
See, I told you she would like it!  There's nothing wrong with it.
yeah, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
no, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
uhh, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
let me get you a drink.
I'm gonna fix us some drinks.
Ah, you need to help me break in my expensive new set of cocktail making accessories.
Oh and I've got these fancy new cocktail shakers I'm itching to try out.
Ah, you'll be the first to sample from my new set of imported drinking glasses.
Good news, I just fully loaded the bar, with the real quality stuff... only the best for my guests.
Yeah, let me fix us all some drinks.
Yeah, I'm gonna fix us some drinks.
good idea, we need drinks.
that's what I like about you, you get right down to business.
So let me fix us some drinks.
So! Drinks!
What would you like?
So, what's your poison?
How about something fun, 
Let's have something fun,
We should have something fun,
Why don't I make us one of my inventions, 
How about one of my famous cocktail inventions,
I'd love to make you one of my inventions,
How does a martini sound?
How about a martini?
like a cosmopolitan?
like margaritas?
like sangria?
I've got the perfect bottle of cabernet I've been saving for just such an occasion.
Can I interest you in a single malt Scotch?  It's primo.
Can I suggest a gin high ball?
a flaming vermouth-infused triple cream gin menthol twister?
Martinis...  Great idea!  Classic!
Ah, martinis... 
you've always had good taste.
Fabulous suggestion.  I'll have the same.
Sure, that sounds great, I'll have one too!
Oh, but we can do better than that...!  
Oh, but let's enjoy ourselves tonight...!
Oh, but let's celebrate tonight...!
Oh, but let's live it up tonight...!
I'm a real expert at fixing these, at least that's what everybody tells me.
Everybody tells me I fix the best drinks, so I'm sure you're gonna love this.
I just got a hold of this rare imported Icelandic vermouth I want you to try!
It's what we drink at these high-class poker games I go to with the execs at work.
Grace's dad taught me how to make these, it's a really classy drink.
The guy I play squash with introduced me to this drink, it's really amazing.
We went wine tasting last year in the Napa with Grace's parents and discovered this stuff, it's exquisite.
I served these at our last party, they were a smash.
It's the latest thing, you'll love it.
Beautiful!
Perfect!
Great!  Martini it is.
Alright...!  Cosmopolitans!
Ah margaritas! Yum yum!
Excellent.  Mmm, mmm, sangria!
You got it.  Scotch coming right up!
No...?
What? Oh I thought you'd love that...!
Oh but we should enjoy ourselves tonight...!
Oh, but everybody loves that!
Oh, oh, yeah, that sounds even better!  Great!
Oh yeah, great idea, great idea!
Oh yeah, that's even better!
Ooh, great, why didn't I think of that?
Oh, come on, let's enjoy ourselves tonight...!
Oh, but let's celebrate tonight...!
Oh, but let's live it up tonight...!
Oh, that's no fun...!
Uh, well, you know what, I'm just going to make you a martini.
Uh, well, you know what, I'm just going to make you a cosmopolitan.
Uh, well, I think I'll just make us all margaritas.
Uh, well, I'm just going to make us all some nice sangria.
Uh, well, I'm just going to pour you a glass of this wine.
Uh, well, I'm just going to make you a Scotch.
What...?
Oh come on...
uhh...
but... uhh...
Alright, alright!  
Okay, okay...  
Alright, fine, fine...  
No no, that's fine, that's fine... 
So, anyhow...
We can indulge in my new cocktail accessories some other time.
I keep my bar fully stocked with the best money can buy, so we can always do it another time.
Some other time -- I have a repertoire of classic drink concoctions that never go out of style.
Anyway, about the drinks...
This reminds me of the time we had your book group friends over.
So much for celebrating tonight.
Excuse me for wanting to enjoy ourselves...
I'll just make something nice for myself then...
Okay! Good!  I'll just whip up these bad boys real quick!
Alright!  That's what I wanted to hear!  It'll just take me a short minute here.
Excellent!  It won't take me more than a minute!
Aha!  Great!  Drinks comin' right up!
What?  What was that?
What was that?
Wait, what did you say?
Okay look I'm just going to open a bottle of merlot and make everybody happy.  
trust me, it's good stuff.
You know what why I don't I just open a bottle of merlot and make it easy.  
We don't need to fight over this.
You know I'm just going to open a bottle of merlot or something, 
I just want us to be relaxed and enjoy ourselves tonight.
Y -- yeah, yeah, time for a drink.
W -- wait, uh, uh -- we need drinks.
Uh -- well, we should drink.
Y - yeah, uh, it's fine, it's fine...
N - no, no, it's -- it's fine, it's fine...
Uh, well, it -- it's fine, it's fine...
W - what?  Yeah, yeah, drinks coming right up!
What?  N - no, no, no, drinks coming right up!
What?  Yeah, no, uh, drinks coming right up!
Yeah, no, uh, merlot will be fine, that's -- that's fine...
N - no, no, merlot will be fine, that's fine...
Uh, well, merlot will be fine, that's fine...
In terms of drinks...
Grace, I assume you want your usual... 'a lovely, very cold glass of Chardonnay'.
Grace, a glass of Chardonnay for you?   as if I have to ask...
Grace usually refuses to drink what I'm making, but tonight I get the feeling she'll join us.
I think tonight Grace is ready to venture beyond her usual glass of Chardonnay and join us in a real drink.
Grace, perhaps you'll take a walk on the wild side and join us in a real drink?
What do you say Grace, skip the Chardonnay and join us in a genuine drink for once?
What do you say Grace, I know it's not your favorite, but help us finish the bottle?
How about you Grace, can I pour you a glass?  Let's all drink together.
Grace, maybe at least you'll drink with me?  I'll make us something real nice, light on the alcohol, what do you say?
Grace, I don't want to drink alone, what do you say, join me in a nice cocktail?
Grace, I assume you also don't want a real drink, correct?
Grace, you don't want to drink anything special tonight either, am I right?
Grace, I know what you want, but I'll ask anyway...  what would you like to drink?
Grace, what can I get you to drink tonight?  Surprise me.
Of course.
Yes, dear.
Ah, Chardonnay, certainly.
Oh, Chardonnay!  Sure thing.
Oh! Okay.  Good.
Oh! Uh...  Okay.
Fine.
Great.
Okay.
Alright...
Nothing?
Uh, yeah, I -- I was just going to ask Grace what she wants.
No, uh, I was just going to ask Grace what she wants.
Well, I was just going to ask Grace what she wants.
Yeah, yeah, I, heh -- I know what you want, Grace.
No, I -- I know what you want, Grace.
Well, I, uh -- I know what you want, Grace.
Chardonnay, come and get it.
Here's your wine, Grace.
Your Chardonnay is ready, dear.
Here you go Grace, you get to be the first to drink.
Here Grace, you be the first to try this.
Here Grace, I poured you the first glass.
Grace, I'm giving you the first glass.
Alright Grace, yours is ready.
Here Grace, yours is ready.
Alright Grace, your drink is ready.

Here we are... hope you like it!
Here's your drink!

Here's yours.
This is yours.
Here you go.
Here's your drink.
Well I'll just put this on the bar for you.
You know what I'm just going to put this on the bar for you.
Ah, shit!
Ah, dammit!
Ah, crap!
Ah, I broke two of my new crystal wine glasses.  
Jesus!
Ah, two of my new crystal wine glasses just broke.  
Dammit!
Uh oh... um, Grace...
Um, uh, Grace...
I'm out of your wine.
I'm out of your juice.
I'm out of your water.
Sorry, I forgot to buy more on my latest shopping trip.
I'm sorry, I forgot to buy some last time I went shopping.
I know, I know, I'm sorry... what else can I get you?
I know, I know, I'm sorry... can I get you something else?
What?
You what?
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, Grace, sorry.
Oh,

I was saying that there's this picture from our recent trip to Italy.
Yeah, that's a new photo from our trip to Italy a couple of weeks ago...
Come here, I want you to look at this!

Jet lag, I guess... 
Right!  Love!  Romance!
Well, I'm not going to bore you with the details... 
but it was a very romantic weekend.  Wasn't it, Grace?
Uh!  Everything in Italy was so romantic...

Oh, ha ha, thanks --
Oh, well, thanks --
Ha...
that's why we like you, you're not afraid to give us shit...
Wha... uh...
Oh, ha ha... heh...
I'm not sure I should offer you a drink, maybe you got a headstart on your way over here...
Well, we're all friends here.
I guess that drink is already hitting you.
flirting with me is only going to make me want to return the favor.
Well, 
aren't you the flirt tonight.
Ha ha, I'll let you flirt with me this one time, cuz we're friends.
Whoa, hold on there my friend, let's keep that raging libido of yours under control tonight.
Oh, well that was nice, I'm sure Grace appreciates that.
Oh, that's nice of you.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited him over?
Oh, that's nice of you.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited her over?
Oh, heh, you're hugging me...
Oh, uh, you're hugging me...
Oh, uh, thanks -- thanks for the hug...
Oh, thanks, uh, for the hug...
Oh, uh, 
thanks...
Oh, 
uh, thanks...
Oh, uh, 
that was nice of you...
Oh, 
uh, that's nice of you...
What?  No no, everything's fine, we're fine... 
Huh?  No no, we're fine, everything's fine... 
What?  No, I'm good, we're good, everything's good... 
Huh?  No, we're good, I'm good, everything's good... 
Oh, well, ha, you know what they say...
Love is blind.  Marriage is the eye opener. 
If variety is the spice of life, marriage is the big can of leftover Spam.  Heh heh.
If it weren't for marriage, men and women would have to fight with total strangers.
Marriage is a wonderful institution, but who wants to live in an institution?  Heh heh.
If love is the answer, could you rephrase the question?
Heh heh ha ha ha ha, ha...
Just kidding. 
Oh god, let's not talk about relationship stuff tonight... 
I want us to have a good time.
Ha ha!  Oh I think we're going to need some drinks first if we're going to talk about sex.
Ha ha!  Oh I think we're going to need a few more drinks if we're going to talk about sex.
Uhh, heh heh...
yeah, I don't know, you're in a weird mood tonight...
Heh heh, that's not exactly a topic you want to joke around about... 
Oh... you know our wedding picture is the first thing everyone notices when they enter the room.
Well, yeah...
Ha ha, well, you're in a contrary mood tonight, Grace. 
Yeah, 
Yeah, before, I wanted to say,
if there's one thing Grace is really passionate about, it's her decorating...
No it's a real creative thing for you, it's really great, you get so into it --
Oh, you'll never guess where I took that picture.
Heh, I'll tell you about it in a sec.
Into them?  You love your sculptures so much I'm not even allowed to touch them!
Anyhow, 
Grace is infatuated with them.
Well, I don't know what the hell it is, so it must be good!  Heh heh heh!  
Heh.
Ha ha!
Oh, that brass bull, that's a gift from my business contact in Barcelona --
Uh, yeah,  I will, later, after our friend leaves.
Oh, yeah, let me fix us all some drinks in a sec!
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna fix us some drinks in a sec!
Oh that -- that's just a little joke advice giver toy thing that I like to consult now and then...
when I need a little guidance.  Ha ha.
Stocking stuffer, heh. 
Ah, yeah, this is some kind of amazing view.  I never get tired of looking at it.
I think you're trying to get on Grace's good side tonight.
Oh that's nice Grace, our friend seems happy to see you again after so long.
Well, you two seem to be getting along well already.
Oh, um...
Oh, uh...
Grace, it's okay, a little criticism never hurt anybody... it's good!
It's good!
What?!
I think we need some drinks.
I think I'm ready for a refill.
Alright, alright, break it up you two.
Okay, okay, that's enough you two love birds.
if I didn't know better, I'd say you were flirting with me.
Oh,
heh heh, I think you're flirting with me.
Flirting with me isn't exactly the way to get on my good side tonight.
Are you flirting with me to be funny?
What?  No, I'm good, we're good, everything's good... 
Huh?  No, we're good, I'm good, everything's good... 
Oh, well, heh, you know what they say...
All marriages are happy. It's living together afterwards that is difficult. 
Marriage is not a word -- it's a sentence.
Marriage is like a hot bath. Once you get used to it, it's not so hot.
Heh heh...
Just kidding. 
Oh Jesus let's not bring up unhappy relationships and stuff tonight, heh... 
that's not fun. 
Let's enjoy tonight.
Brr, I'm going to have to turn up the thermostat if we're going to talk about sex, heh.
Uhh... As Grace likes to say, I'm not in the mood to talk about sex tonight, heh heh.
mmm uhh...
geez, you're in some kind of weird mood tonight...
Let's keep things happy, okay?  Tonight's supposed to be fun.
Oh, I love how everyone always notices our wedding picture!
Well, Grace, you look beautiful in that picture!
What are you talking about...
Oh, yeah, yeah, 
I have to tell you about our recent trip to Italy!
Yeah, yeah, I'll tell you about it in a sec.
Oh, that brass bull, I love that, isn't that cool?  It's a business gift --
I know, alright, I'll get rid of it later, geez, heh, heh, huh.  
Oh, yeah, let me fix us all some drinks in a sec!
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna fix us some drinks in a sec!
Heh heh, no it's just one of those little joke advice toys, you know.
It's a toy, I'm allowed to have a toy.
Ah, yeah, yeah, this view makes you feel on top of the world...
Yeah.
That's a nice thing to say, I'm sure Grace appreciates that.
Oh, that's nice of you to say.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited him over?
Oh, that's nice of you to say.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited her over?
Oh! Ha ha ha, yeah --
yeah --
Huh, oh, well --
Grace, it's fine, you know how our friend can sometimes like to tease,  that's all.
What...?  
I --
Ah, yeah, I know, I know...  Ha, good one man. 
Ah, yeah, I know, I know...  Ha, good one. 
Ha ha, no, Grace, our friend's just kidding around, heh.
Ha ha, Grace, no no, he's just joking.  Ha ha.
Ha ha, Grace, no no, she's just joking.  Ha ha.
you are such the flirt tonight!
flirting with me will only make it harder to let you leave tonight.
good one, good one, I almost took you seriously for a sec there.
Oh, man, you weirded me out for a second there, heh heh, ha ha.
Oh! ha ha, you're hugging me!
Oh! you're hugging me, ha ha heh heh...
Oh, uh, thanks -- thanks for the hug...
Oh, thanks, uh, for the hug, heh...
Oh! uh, 
thanks, heh...
Oh, uh, 
that was nice of you...
Oh, 
uh, that's nice of you...
Some days you're the dog, some days you're the hydrant.
I should let you know, I don't necessarily agree with everything I say.
I should warn you, I never know how much of what I say is true.
One good thing about being wrong is the joy it brings to Grace, heh.
Women like silent men. They think they're listening.
There are two theories about arguing with women. Neither one works.
Yeah, you know,
Yeah, well, I think,
Grace's decorating has been such a great outlet for her.
And I'm always encouraging her to buy new stuff, the latest trend...  
Only the best for us, right Grace?
Aren't they cool?  Makes you feel like you're in an art museum.
What, I thought you'd like that...!
Well I know a good investment when I see it.
Wow Grace you sure are getting your share of praise tonight!
Jesus you are just full of good things to say tonight!
Oh, ha ha, I --
Oh, ha ha ha, well... 
well --
you're really trying to get on Grace's good side tonight, aren't you, huh?
He's just teasing you, Grace.
She's just teasing you, Grace.
Ha ha, he doesn't mean that Grace.
Ha ha, she doesn't mean that Grace.
He's just joking around...!
She's just joking around...!
what's the deal?
You know, we didn't invite you over to be... criticized...
No, no, it's fine, it's fine... 
what --
You know I was hoping we could keep things positive tonight...  you know?
Yeah... okay...
Okay, c'mon, that's enough of that.  It was kind of funny the first time, but, um --
Yeah... heh heh, okay... 
Whoa hold on a second... this is... this isn't right.
Look just give it a rest, alright?
Alright.
Grace, he's only playing around --
Grace, she's only playing around --
It's a joke.
What? Grace, no --
He's just kidding!  It's a joke.
She's just kidding!  It's a joke.
Oh, that's nice Grace, I think a hug was just what you needed.
Wow Grace you sure are getting your share of affection tonight!
Oh, ha ha, I --
Oh, ha ha, well...
well --
Uhh, you keep trying to pacify us... 
we're fine!
What?  Hey, no, there's nothing... 
you keep, um... 
no I don't no no, everything's okay... 
no, everything's okay... 
What?  Hey, no, there's nothing... 
you, you keep... 
uhh, no, everything's okay, seriously...! 
Yeah, yeah, good, we're -- we're friends...
Yeah, right, good, yeah, we're -- we're friends... hmm...
God, what is it with you and divorce tonight?  What's the deal?
Oh please, I don't believe that for a second.
What?  The garbage?
Yeah.
What?  Dry cleaning?
Yeah.
What?  Cleaning woman?
Y -- Yeah.
Uhh, 
come on, what are you bringing this up again for?  
Heh heh, the last time the topic of infidelity came up at a party, two of our friends ended up divorced, heh heh. 
It's a, it's best not to go there... heh heh!
See -- see, Grace, people can't help noticing our wedding picture! 
Grace, I happen to think we look very happy in this picture, alright?  
Okay.
See Grace, people can't stop talking about your decorating!
Okay... shh...
Yeah, yeah, I've, I've got to tell you about Italy!
Dammit Grace, would it kill you to be positive for once?  God.  
More like obsessed...
But in a good way!
That's an odd thing to say for someone who claims to like art.
Jesus, Grace, it was a gift, and an expensive one at that!
Yes, I'll get rid of it.
Yeah, hang on, ooh, I'm going to make you one of my fabulous drinks in just a minute!
What?  It's like, a funny bar toy.
Ah, yeah, this view cost us a pretty penny, I'll tell you that.
Oh, Grace, no, no, h -- how can you say that?
Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh yeah.  It -- it's definitely got that.
I love it, I -- I really love it...!
Oh no, no... 
it -- it's fine... 
Oh, Grace, no, everything's okay...
Yeah!  Yeah, this huge couch is so... huge!  
give it -- give it a try!
it's a nice couch... 
Uhh... a little love seat... what? 
I, I -- I think it's f -- fabulous.  I -- I really do.
it's good... 
Oh yeah, yeah, everybody always says how much they love Grace's sculptures!
I love them, I really love them!
they're nice... 
Oh yeah, yeah, it -- it's the first thing everyone notices when they come in!
it looks good here...
Yeah Grace was the highest bidder at an auction for it!
no...
Yeah, yeah, it really cheers me up to stand here and look out...
it's such a nice view... 
I -- I think it's really nice!  Really nice.
no...
So, about Grace's decorating, I think you think it's... perfectly fine. 
There, see, Grace, n -- no one has a problem with your decorating, everything's fine!
Grace, everything's fine, no one is complaining about your decorating...
God, you're such a perfectionist.  
Well this painting seems like a pretty good investment to me.
But wait, what -- uhh... what are you -- everything's fine...!
But it looks fine...  God... 
It's just decorating for Christ's sake, why are you turning this into some big -- issue --
No, it -- it's definitely not my thing.  
Ah, see, Grace, I was right, no one has a problem with your decorating!
Well, well, I was right Grace, you're the only one unhappy with your decorating.
Uh, Grace, s -- sweetie, maybe now you'll believe me when I tell you how great your decorating is.  Besides, this painting is a great investment, I'm sure.
W -- well, uh, it, it always amazes me, how after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace still has the energy to decorate... 
W -- wait, wait, wait...  uh, take a -- take a closer look...  You have to let it soak in a little while before you say anything.
Ah, see, I knew he would like it!   I knew you would like it, everybody does.
Ah, see, I knew she would like it!   I knew you would like it, everybody does.
Grace, oh, no, we don't need to do that.
Yeah, yeah...!
There's nothing wrong with it...
Oh, Grace...
Grace, it looks fine...
Yeah I like this couch.
Grace, it looks fine...
Yeah it looks good next to the bar.
I can't imagine anyone not liking this!
I always hear people talking about them at our parties.
There's nothing wrong with them...
Grace, they're perfectly fine...
I get lots of compliments about it.
Oh, Grace...  
Grace, it looks nice there...!
We just acquired it at an art auction.
well, you're the one who bought it...
Well you seen one, you seen 'em all....
Yeah, it really makes me feel like I've made it.
There's nothing you can say wrong about this...
Hmm.
So yeah, about Grace's decorating, I think you agree with me. 
See, Grace, everybody always loves your decorating!   It's beautiful.
Grace, it seems no one has a problem with your decorating...
Okay, okay, I tried... 
Ha ha, uhh, yeah I hadn't thought of that...  Mmm... well anyhow this painting will be a great investment, I'm sure.
Wait, what?
Uh... okay, good, that's good...
Huh... okay, good, that's -- that's good...
I --  uhh.
There, Grace, I try to tell you, everybody loves your decorating!
See, Grace, as always, you're the only one unhappy with your decorating.
Oh yeah, yeah, uh, that would have been good. Anyhow I'm sure this painting is an excellent investment.
Well, it's funny how after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace finds the time to decorate... and re-decorate... 
Well hold on, hold on, take a closer look, give it a chance to soak in a little.
Ah, yes, 
I knew you'd like it.  See, Grace?
Oh, 
you've got to take a look at this amazing photo from our recent trip to Italy...
No Grace, our friend will love this!
Oh, yeah, you've got to take a look at this amazing photo from our recent trip to Italy...
So, uh, come here, look at this, it's, it -- it's great, take a look!

Grace...! 
Now now, now,

In a word, in a single word, what does this say to you?
Shh!
W -- well actually just -- just try to think of one word...
Jesus, Grace, would you just let me do this, please?  
Uh, just one word.
Uh, no no, that -- that's not it --
No, no...  
take another look,  this says...
Uh, think, think, w -- what does this say to you?
Well, the thing is, you see, this trip to Italy... it was our second honeymoon!
So in a word, this says...
Romance!  It, it -- it says... romance...!
Well look I won't bother you two with this anymore... 
I just wanted to share this with you, that's all.
Not everybody appreciates this kind of thing.
I thought we'd have a good time there, that's all.
Y -- yes, that's it!  Love!  Romance!  I knew you'd guess it!
Well, I -- I'm not going to bore you with the details... 
b -- but it -- it was a very romantic weekend.  Wasn't it, Grace?

Jet lag, I guess... 
Right!  Love!  Romance!
Well, I'm not going to bore you with the details... 
but it was a very romantic weekend.  Wasn't it, Grace?
Uh!  Everything in Italy was so romantic... the scenery, the food, the wine...

it's easy... the answer is romance.  Romance.  That's all.  It's no big deal.  Sorry.  Sorry!
No, look, hey, uh, forget I mentioned it, I just thought it would be interesting, that's all.
You know, uh,

So,
I was going to ask you --
No, no no no, our friend's here, we can let the answering machine get it.
Grace, come on, don't be rude.
Why, are you expecting a phone call?
No...
It's probably just one your art gallery friends, it seems like they're always calling you.
Besides it's probably some telemarketer trying to sell us another set of hand-crafted French tableware, heh heh.
Besides it's probably some telemarketer trying to sell us another set of timeless New England antiques for the master bathroom, heh, heh.
What?  Wait, wait, let's just wait for the answering machine...
Uhh, what?  That's -- heh heh, hey, way way wait a second... 
What?  Jesus, just -- no, no, I just, I just want to wait for the answering machine...!
Just hold on...
no!  Don't do that.
Uhh, that's my mother, I can hear her loud voice.
Okay, she's confused, as usual... just -- just hang it up.
Oh, good, you hung up. I don't want to talk to her.
Grace, Grace, come on, I don't want to talk to them right now...
No no, come on, we're entertaining a friend in our new apartment...
the last thing I want to do is talk to my parents.
Uhh, no, they're ignorant, they don't know 'black tie only' from... black bean chili.
Uhh, no, they're ignorant, they wouldn't know what a cumberbund from a cucumber.
So,
I was going to ask you --
Oh, I'll get it --
Grace, no, I want --
No, are you?
Oh!
Oh, it's your parents!  I'll get it --
I want to say hello --
I wanted to say hello --
Well, Grace's parents...

Well, we're, kind of, debating in front of our friend.
Well, we're, kind of, getting worked up in front of our friend.

Grace, uh, has a passion for hors doeurves, uh...  uh... If -- if it fits on a cracker, Grace will put it there.
Grace makes the most amazing hors doeurves, heh... uh...  As good as her mom used to make.
Uhh, jesus... 
Uhh... boy... 
Heh... this is nothing... we -- we -- we're just... she's... 
Look, don't pay any attention to this... this... it's nothing...  uhh...
I -- I hope you don't think... mmm... there's... there's nothing... heh...
We're fine, you know, we -- we're fine, this -- this is just... 
Oh, uh, Grace has been kind of stressed out lately, with work, and, and, and I try to give her advice, but, um...
Uh, heh heh, Grace has been really, stressed out lately, I try to calm her down and get her to relax, but... uhh...
Uh, heh, Grace has been feeling, I don't know, overwhelmed or something lately, even though I keep trying to make her feel better...
Heh heh, Grace is still, I don't know, adjusting to life in an apartment, and uh, she grew up in a big house, you know, so, heh...
Uh, heh heh, Grace has been feeling, I don't know, like, always wanting more, and more, and, and I'm not sure what it is... heh heh...
Heh, we've been a little stressed out lately, with our -- with our new work project, and Grace's redecorating, and all the parties, ugh...
Uh, heh heh, I'm always trying to give us the best stuff, you know, but she doesn't, she'd, she doesn't, I don't know...
Heh heh heh, heh, I've been travelling a bit, you know, heh, for business, and maybe we haven't spent enough time together lately, I don't, um, I don't know...
Heh heh heh, well, we've been a little stressed out lately, she just, she needs to, I mean, we need to, you know, just, uh, you know...
Heh heh, well we've been a little stressed out lately, I don't know why she's just, I mean, we can't, we can't, I just, you know, just, I don't know...
Yes?
What?
Yes, what?
uhh...
Wait, 
where -- where are you going?
Well, I'm sorry that we're all having this... misunderstanding... tonight.
Yeah, well, I wish we weren't having this... uh... misunderstanding... tonight... heh...
Uhh, Jesus, why are we all having this... misunderstanding... tonight... uhh... 
Oh... uhh... that's nice of you... huh... you know, this is all just a big miscommunication... uhh...
what are you trying to do, get me in trouble?  
jesus, you're going to get me in big trouble!  
come on, don't get me in more trouble than I already am!
Grace is right in the other room!
Grace could come back any second!
Grace might be able to hear you!
Oh, well, that... uh...
um... uh...
wha... you... eh... uh...
Um... well... uh....
Gr -- Grace, honey, did you find the prosciutto?
Gr -- Grace, honey, did you find the crackers?
Did you find the prosciutto?
Did you find the crackers?
Never mind!   
That's the problem with this goddamn apartment, lousy acoustics.
And then Grace buys all of this ridiculously expensive furniture that just sucks up your voice when you're talking.  
I feel like someone's muffling me when I sit on her new couch.
All Grace has to do is stand ten feet away and then I can't hear half the words she's saying.
I don't know what the problem is.  Drives me crazy.
um...
Jesus, what was that?
Grace, what happened?
What happened?
Oh, god, I hope that didn't break, that thing is a life saver.
Oh, god, I hope that didn't break, we can't get through a week without that.
Grace turns into a real klutz when she's angry.
Uhh!  Heh!  You... wha... oh... heh heh...
Uhh!  You -- you... wha... ah... heh...
Hey -- hey, uh...
I meant to tell you, we're going to have this big, big party next weekend.
Do you -- do you think you can make it?  
It's gonna be great.
Oh, um...
Oh!  uh, heh heh, hey... um...
Sweet...
Hey, hey, uh -- why don't you, um... invite that woman in accounting you were telling me about... um...
What was her name... 
Veronica?
Vivian?
Vanessa?
Uhh... Oh!  Uh, it's, uh, she -- she -- she's a, she -- she's this interesting woman that, uh, our friend works with.
She's, uh... into what, skydiving... or was it scuba diving...?
What?  Grace, honey, you know, we're always trying to invite new people to our parties, keep things fresh...
um...
Grace...
Oh, hmm, mmm, maybe someone else told me about that... um...
No, Grace, no, everything's fine, we didn't talk about anything.
What was that?
Never mind... I can't find the brie.  Where did you hide it?
What?!  Grace, I specifically asked you to buy brie!
Jesus, do you just not hear me when I talk to you?  Just this morning I asked you to buy brie!
No, okay, okay, it's okay, it -- it's fine, it's fine... 

##6
What was that?
Something's been going on in here... 
Something's been happening in here... 
God, it's turning into a little love-fest in here.
God, it's all so touchy-feely in here.
Nothing, I just hope you two enjoyed a little alone time together... 
Nothing, I'm just glad you two had some quality time... 
Anyway... our Norwegian cheese slicer is in the dishwasher, and I didn't feel like hand washing it, so...
Anyway... I was going to bring out some pesto infused sun dried tomatoes, but they need to marinate a little longer, so...
Anyway... I was going to bring out some goat cheese, but we're out of pine nuts, so...
God!  What have you two been talking about in here?
Maybe I should have stayed in the kitchen.
Uhh, God!  What the hell has been going on in here?
Heh... should I just go back to the kitchen?
Alright...
Grace, what are you saying in there?
What?
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine!
Christ, what the hell is going on...
Jesus, what in the hell is going on tonight...
Why is this happening tonight?
Why does this have to happen tonight?
What?  Oh...  
I... uhh...
What?  Oh...  
I...  uhh...
Okay, maybe just now you were just trying to be nice... or something... I don't know... 
Maybe just now you meant well, I don't know... but... 
Look, you didn't have to follow me in here... 
You say these things and then you follow me in here...  heh, heh... okay... 
I can't believe you've followed me in here, after all that... 
Look, what you've said, tonight, you probably think...
Look, the things you've said tonight, maybe you're trying to say...
that... mmm... my advice to Grace isn't really helping her or something... that she thinks I'm bossing her around, or...
that my attempts to help Grace are... I don't know... making her avoid me... or something...
that I'm trying to make Grace feel better, but it's... mmm... it's making her feel worse... or something...
that Grace is... mmm... that she needs to feel... privileged... you know, how she grew up in a rich house and all that...
that Grace just keeps wanting... more... and more, of something... like I don't even know what...
that we've been a little stressed out lately, with our new work project, and Grace's redecorating, and all the parties...
that obviously I'm trying to give Grace all the best stuff money can buy, that but... she's just not... she's not...
that maybe that I'm traveling... too much, and I'm distracted... somehow... by all the traveling, or...
that we've been really stressed out lately, or something, and that she just needs to... 
I mean, we just need... ah, I don't know...
that we need to... somehow... just agree on something, for once... I mean, just... uhh, agree...
What? uhh...  Nothing, Grace, nothing!
Jesus.   Nothing!  I'm coming!
Hey, look, let's just go back.
No problem, Grace, everything's hunky dory.
uhh... this is... 
I... 
I have to go back to the living room.
I'm... 
I have to go back to the living room.
Uhh... you know what, this is not really what I want to hear right now... 
let's just go back to the living room.
Uhh... okay, look, I -- I don't need to get any more worked up right now... 
so let's just go back into the living room, okay?
You came in here to tell me this?  Uhh...
Is this why you came in here, to tell me this?  Uhh...
Uh, alright, alright, everything's alright, heh, let's just... let's just go back into the living room...
Everything's alright...

Yeah, it's in your blood, you grew up with this stuff.
Grace, come on, what are you talking about?
I love this style, I feel like I'm inside one of your ads, it's great!
Oh come on!
Jesus why can't you just be happy with this?  This is fine!
Oh my God.
I love it, this is a really exclusive couch, very few people own this couch!
Oh come on, a little love seat?!  
I love it, this is a really exclusive armoire, very few people own this armoire!
Oh yeah, yeah, everybody always says how much they love Grace's sculptures!
Jesus why can't you just be happy with them?  They're fine!
Oh yeah, yeah, it's the first thing everyone notices when they come in!
Yeah Grace was the highest bidder at an auction for this!
Yeah, I love this view, it makes me feel like a million bucks!
I love this furniture, some of this is really exclusive stuff, very few people own this stuff!
See, try to understand, even after a full day's work designing magazine ads,
Grace somehow finds the time to decorate and and and and redecorate -- 
No, no no no no no, you've got to understand, Grace loves expensive furniture, she was totally spoiled growing up,
you should see the inside of her parents house.
Ah, right, right, 
of course you like it!
See Grace you have no reason to complain -- there's just nothing to complain about.
Grace, everything's fine, no one is complaining about your decorating!  
Uhh, Grace, come on, people like it, you're the only one --
You're never happy... 
No one has a problem with your decorating but you.
Uhh, let's not talk about the damn decorating anymore...
Uhh, it's just decorating for Christ's sake, you're turning this into some big issue --
Yeah and with our income cut in half, we'd be living in some basement apartment in Queens, as if you could ever handle that...
Well, well, I was right Grace, you're the only one unhappy with your decorating --
Grace, you're good at it, you're so good at it!
It's just like your job, you design great magazine ads!  
I keep telling her that, she never listens.
wait, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
no, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
Yeah, uh, no, uh the decorating is fine, heh!

Grace --
Grace, no, no, don't say that!
This style make me feel like I'm inside one of your ads, it's great!
Not coming together... what?
Grace... come on!
This is a really exclusive couch, very few people own this couch...
A little love seat... what?
This is a really exclusive armoire, very few people own this armoire.
A monstrosity... what?
Everybody always says how much they love Grace's sculptures.
Revolting...? what?
It's the first thing everyone notices when they come in.
Doesn't go...? what?
Grace was the highest bidder at an auction for this.
Tacky...? what?
This view makes me feel like a million bucks.
Trees...? what?
This furniture is really exclusive stuff, very few people own this stuff.
Don't go together... what?
Well, you have to appreciate how after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace can find the time to redecorate -- 
No no, no no, see, Grace loves expensive furniture, she...
grew up in this really nice house, with really nice couches and fancy dishes, and, and she can't live without this stuff.
she can't live without this stuff.
Ah, yeah, 
I knew you'd like it.  
See Grace you don't realize how good this all looks -- and, and how good you look!
Grace, everything's fine!  No one is complaining about your decorating --
Grace, listen to me, people like your decorating, you're the only one who feels this way!
You're good at decorating, trust yourself.
Wait! Grace, I don't know where you're getting this --
Oh, yeah, we've seen how your artist friends live, as if you could survive that kind of lifestyle!  Give me a break!
Uhh, let's not talk about the damn decorating anymore...
Aha, I knew it, I was right Grace, you're the only one unhappy with your decorating --
Grace, come on, you're so good at it!  
Just like you're good at your job -- you design great magazine ads!  Can't you see that?
You should stick with what you're good at.  Trust me on this.
yeah, see, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
no, see, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
uhh, see, Grace, nothing's wrong, everything's fine!
Yeah, no, Grace, you're so good at decorating!

Grace, our friend agrees, what could be more romantic than that?
Grace, I -- I just wanted to share that moment with our friend.
Uhh...  See, Grace, despite what you think, I am a romantic, caring, loving husband --
Yes, this is every woman's dream, to get proposed to on one knee like that!

What?  Where are you going?
Goddamn, what you are you hinting at?  I'm getting really sick of it.
Look I'll leave you two to keep chatting about love and marriage and all that good shit. 
I'm just going to get something from the kitchen.
Hey, what's going on in there?
Grace, what's going on in there?
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Okay, 
you know what?  I think you should leave.
Alright, 
that's it, you've got to leave.
You know what, 
that's it, you need to leave.
Okay, 
I think this evening is over, you've got to leave.
come on, you've got to go.
Jesus, we've had enough, you've got to go.
we're through messing around, you've got to go.
I'm sorry, but, uhh, I don't know what the deal is with you tonight.
There's only so much you can expect to put up with, you know?
We invited you over, but this is just not working out.
We can put up with a lot, but we have our limits, you know?
We'll be fine -- you should just go.
We'll be fine -- you just have to go.
We'll be fine -- just go.
Oh, God, you're planning to leave again?
Oh, Jesus, you want to leave again?
Oh, God, 
this is the third time you're acting really weird!
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah. 
Ha ha, yeah! 
Yeah! 
Hmm... 
Oh, okay...  
You don't agree... 
What...?  uhh...
Okay...  uhh...
If that's how you feel...  uhh...
uh, well... uh...
Mmm... hmm...
uh... 
Huh... well, yeah, hold on, um...  
Um, well, hold on, I was going to say...  
Mmm... well hold on a sec...  
Um, well, hold on, hold on... 
Hold on, let me finish.  
Well, wait, wait.  I was trying to say...  
Okay, well hold on -- hold on a second.  
Can I finish?  
Wait, let -- let me finish, alright? 
Okay...  well...  
Oh, well, uh, eh, uh, hold on... 
Oh, hmm... well, uh, hold -- hold on... 
Well, h -- hold on, hold on... 
Oh, well, hold on... 
Oh, hmm... well, hold on... 
Well, uh, h -- hold on, hold on... 
Oh, well, h -- hold on... 
I think you're trying to get on Grace's good side tonight.
Oh that's nice Grace, our friend seems happy to see you again after so long.
That's a nice thing to say, I'm sure Grace appreciates that.
Oh, that's nice of you to say.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited him over?
Oh, that's nice of you to say.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited her over?
Oh, um...
Oh, uh...
Oh! Ha ha, ha ha, yeah -- 
Ha ha,
Heh, oh, well --
that's why we like you, you're not afraid to give us shit...
Grace, it's fine, you know how our friend can sometimes like to tease,  that's all.
What?!
We need drinks.
We're so ready for a second round of drinks.
What...?  
I --
Heh.  Good one man, good one.
Heh, uh, good one, good one.
Okay, come on, let's keep it clean tonight, alright? 
No no no, let's not -- let's not do that tonight.  Please.
Heh, alright, alright, break it up, break it up.
Okay, okay, that's enough... let's not go there.
if I didn't know better, I'd say you were flirting with me.
Oh,
heh heh, I think you're flirting with me.
you are such the flirt tonight!
flirting with me will only make it harder to let you leave tonight.
Flirting with me isn't exactly the way to get on my good side tonight.
Are you flirting with me to be funny?
Ha ha ha, good one, good one, I almost took you seriously for a sec there.
Oh, man, ha ha, you weirded me out for a second there, heh heh.
Oh, well that was nice, I'm sure Grace appreciates that.
Oh, that's nice of you.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited him over?
Oh, that's nice of you.  Grace, aren't you glad we invited her over?
Oh, heh, you're hugging me...
Oh, uh, heh, you're hugging me...
Oh, uh, thanks -- thanks for the hug...
Oh, thanks, uh, for the hug...
Oh, uh, 
thanks...
Oh, 
uh, thanks...
Oh, uh, 
that was nice of you...
What?  No no, everything's fine, we're fine... 
What?  No, no, no I'm good, we're good, e -- everything's good... 
Huh?  No no no, we're good, no no, I'm good, everything's good... 
What?  N - n - no no, I -- I'm good, w -- we're good, e - e - everything's good... 
Huh?  No, we're good, I -- I'm good, e - everything's good... 
Some days you're the dog, some days you're the hydrant.
I should let you know, I don't necessarily agree with everything I say.
I should warn you, I never know how much of what I say is true.
One good thing about being wrong is the joy it brings to Grace.
Women like silent men. They think they're listening.
There are two theories about arguing with women. Neither one works.
Oh, well, ha, you know what they say...
Love is blind.  Marriage is the eye opener.  Heh heh.
If variety is the spice of life, marriage is the big can of leftover Spam.
If it weren't for marriage, men and women would have to fight with total strangers.
Marriage is a wonderful institution, but who wants to live in an institution? 
If love is the answer, could you rephrase the question?  
Heh heh, heh heh.
Just kidding. 
Oh, well, heh, you know what they say...
All marriages are happy. It's living together afterwards that is difficult. 
Marriage is not a word -- it's a sentence.
Marriage is like a hot bath. Once you get used to it, it's not so hot.
Heh heh...
Just kidding. 
Oh god, let's not talk about relationship stuff tonight... 
can we do that?
Oh Jesus let's not bring up unhappy relationships and stuff tonight... 
can we do that?  
Thank you.
Ha ha ha!  Oh I think we're going to need some drinks first if we're going to talk about sex.
Ha ha ha!  Oh I think we're going to need a few more drinks if we're going to talk about sex.
Brr, I'm going to have to turn up the thermostat if we're going to talk about sex.
Uhh... As Grace likes to say, I'm not in the mood to talk about sex tonight.
yeah, I don't know, you're -- you're in a weird mood tonight...
Heh heh, that's not exactly a, a -- a topic you want to joke around about... 
geez, you're in some kind of weird mood tonight...
Let's, uh, keep things happy, okay?  Tonight's supposed to be fun.
Oh... you know our wedding picture is the first thing everyone notices when they enter the room.
Well, heh, yeah...
Oh, Christ...!
Oh, heh, I -- I love how everyone always notices our wedding picture!
Well, Grace, you look beautiful in that picture!
Yeah, you know, uh,
Grace's decorating has been such a great outlet for her.
And I'm always encouraging her to buy new stuff... 
the latest trend... only the best for us, right Grace?  Ha ha.
Yeah, 
if there's, uh, one thing Grace is really passionate about, it's her decorating...
No it's a real creative thing for you, it's really great, you get so into it --
Oh, you'll never guess where I took that picture.
I'll tell you about it in a sec.
Oh, yeah, yeah, uh,
I have to tell you about our recent trip to Italy!
Y -- yeah, yeah, I'll tell you about it in a sec.
Makes you feel like you're in an art museum.
What, I thought you'd like that...!
Into them?  You love your sculptures so much I'm not even allowed to touch them!
Heh, anyhow, 
Grace is infatuated with them.
Well I know a good investment when I see it.
Well, heh, I don't know what the hell it is, so it must be good, heh!  
heh heh...
Oh, heh, that brass bull, that's a -- a gift from my business contact in Barcelona --
Uh, yeah,  I will, later, after our friend leaves.
Oh, uh, that brass bull, heh heh, I love that, is -- isn't that cool?  It's a, uh, it's a business gift --
I know, alright, I'll get rid of it later, geez.  
Oh, yeah, let me fix us all some drinks in a sec!
Oh, yeah, uh, I'm gonna fix us some drinks in a sec!
Oh that -- oh, that's just a little joke advice giver toy thing that I like to consult now and then...
when I need a little guidance.  Ha ha.
Stocking stuffer. 
N -- no it's just one of those little joke advice toys, you know.
It's a toy, I'm allowed to have a toy.
Ah, yeah, this is some kind of amazing view.  I never get tired of looking at it.
Ah, yeah, yeah, this view makes you feel on top of the world...
Yeah.
Wow Grace, heh heh, you sure are getting your share of praise tonight!
Jesus you are just full of good things to say tonight!
Oh, ha ha, I --
Oh, ha ha, well -- 
Ha ha, you're really trying to get on Grace's good side tonight, aren't you?  heh...
He's just probably teasing you, Grace.
She's just probably teasing you, Grace.
Ha ha ha, maybe he doesn't mean that Grace.
Ha ha, well maybe she doesn't mean that Grace.
He's probably just joking around...!
She's probably just joking around...!
w - what's the deal?
You know, we didn't invite you over here to hear that...
No no, no no, it's uh, it's fine, it's fine...
what --
You know, I -- I was hoping we could keep things positive tonight...  you know?
It's fine... it's okay...
Okay look, it was barely funny the first time you flirted with Grace --
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, fun.
Whoa whoa, I believe that's the second time tonight you've flirted with Grace.
Well excuse me, I'm having trouble finding the humor in it.
Maybe it's just me...
Grace, he's only playing around --
Grace, she's only playing around --
It's a joke.
What? Grace, no --
He's just kidding!  It's a joke.
She's just kidding!  It's a joke.
Oh, that's nice Grace, I think a hug was just what you needed.
Wow Grace you sure are getting your share of affection tonight!
Oh, ha ha, I --
Oh, ha ha, well --
Uhh, heh, you keep trying to pacify us... 
we're fine!
What?  Hey, there's nothing... 
y - you keep... 
I -- I don't... 
no, no no no, everything's okay... 
What?  Hey, no, th -- there's nothing... 
look, y - you keep... 
no, everything's okay, seriously...! 
Yeah, yeah, good, we're -- we're friends...
Yeah, yeah, r  - right, good, yeah, uh, yeah we're -- we're friends...
God, what is it with you and divorce tonight?  What's the deal?
Oh bullshit.  Heh.
What?  The -- the garbage?
Yeah.
What?  The d - dry cleaning?
Yeah.
What?  The cleaning woman?
Yeah.
Uhh, 
come on, what are you bringing this up again for?  
The last time the topic of infidelity came up at a party, two of our friends ended up divorced.  
So let's not go there...
See -- see, Grace, people can't help noticing our wedding picture! 
Grace, I happen to think we look very happy in this picture, alright?  
Okay.
See Grace, people can't stop talking about your decorating!
Okay... shh, shh...
Yeah, yeah, I've got to tell you about Italy!
Dammit Grace, would it kill you to be positive for once?  God.  
More like obsessed...
That's an odd thing to say for someone who claims to like art, heh heh.
Jesus, Grace, it was a gift, and an expensive one at that!
Yes, I'll get rid of it.
Yeah, hang on, ooh, I'm going to make you one of my fabulous drinks in just a minute, heh!
What?  It's a hilarious little bar toy.
Ah, yeah, this view cost us a pretty penny, I'll tell you that.
Ah...  ha ha... ah... you're... you're...
Uh...  ha ha ha... uh... you... you're really...
No no no, Grace, ha ha, he's having a bit of fun with us tonight, that's all...
No no no, Grace, ha ha, she's having a bit of fun with us tonight, that's all...
No no no, Grace, no no, he's just... testing us tonight, I think, it's funny...
No no no, Grace, no no, she's just... testing us tonight, I think, it's funny...
would you quit it with that already, you're such a suck up!
would you quit it with that already, it's making me ill!
Okay, that's cool, everyone is entitled to their opinions, it's a free country.  
Right, okay, I see how it is.  That's fine.  Heh.
either you think I have a really really good sense of humor, or you think I'm a complete idiot.  
One of the two.
you're either playing a really funny joke on me, or playing me for a fool.  
One of the two.
it's not that I don't want to talk about divorce... 
well, no, come to think of it, I don't want to talk about divorce. 
I don't want to hear this, I'm not listening!  New topic please!  
Goddammit, you are just obsessed with this wedding picture!  
quit it, just drop the whole goddamn Italy thing already. 
Jesus, if I wanted to talk about work so much tonight, I'd have invited you to our team meeting Monday morning!  
I'm going to get rid of it!  I'm going to get rid of it!  Everybody, get off my back already!  
Just leave my little advice toy out of this, okay?  It's not hurting anyone, it just gives advice!
Perhaps.
Could be.
Why not?
Probably true.
Sounds good.
Heh!
Heh... Definitely.
Heh... No doubt about it.
Heh... Count on it.
Heh... It's a sure thing.
Heh... You can bet on it.
Huh...  I don't know about that...
I like it!
I like it, I can carry it around.
Huh, h, get real, heh.
Heh, you can't be serious, heh.
Uh, don't get your hopes up, huh heh heh heh.
Heh -- it's not a good idea, heh.
Heh, heh, I wouldn't if I were you, heh, ho.
Ha ha, ha, this crazy thing, always giving me the wrong advice, heh.
Sorry...!
Definitely, hmm.
No doubt about it, huh.
Count on it, huh.
It's a sure thing, hmm.
You can bet on it, hmm.
Pssh.
Uhh, yeah, right...
Sorry!  I like it, okay?!  It's just a toy.   
Oh, I'm not allowed to have a little toy?!  Jesus.  
All bets are off.
Don't count on it, huh, huh.
No way.
Definitely not.
Not gonna happen.
Uhh...
Y - yeah, yeah...
N - no, no...
Oh, well...
Yeah, yeah, I, heh...
N - n - no, no...
Wha -- uh, heh, oh, well...
Well, we're all friends here, uh...
Huh, y -- you two are really getting along well tonight...
Huh, I think I forgot how well you two get along...
Well... you two are all chummy already... that's, that's good...
Okay, well, I was worried there for a bit you were on Grace's side tonight, heh heh, heh.
Okay, well, you and I are getting along better tonight than I first thought, heh heh!
Alright, good, heh heh, maybe you're on my side tonight after all, ha ha.
oh, you know, ... uh... 
I was just thinking of... um... 
sorry, maybe I'm kind of distracted tonight... 
anyway...
uhh...  
eh, uhh, oh, oh god, I'm sorry, my mind is, uh... heh, somewhere else tonight...  
Oh yeah,  let me tell you about work. I just brought in a new account  - print ads for a line of bridal fashion. 
Very big. 
Oh it's a great, uh, creative opportunity for Grace.  Yeah.
But anyway, I just got back from a client meeting in Barcelona.  I love European culture.
the food, the sights...
Uhh, heh, Grace... 
Our project. 
It was quite a coup when I brought this new account in. Print ads for bridal fashions. 
Very big.
It's how I won you, isn't it?  Ha ha ha ha...
So I have a way with women. What can I say?
Oh, that brass bull, it's a gift from my business contact in Barcelona --
Oh that brass bull, I love that, isn't that cool?
Oh, w -- well, speaking of our work project, um, I -- I'll have to tell you about my trip to Barcelona that landed the contract.
You used to like my charm, heh. I remember I was quite the hit with your sorority sisters. You said it was cute. 
Ha ha, let's not turn this into an advertising meeting, huh? 
Well at least Maria actually wants to see me.
Heh, well, anyway...
Oh yeah, uh, let me tell you about work, uh... I -- I just brought in a new account!  Print ads for a line of bridal fashion. 
Very big. 
Ah, it's a... a great creative opportunity for Grace.
But anyway, I just got back from a client meeting in Barcelona.  I love European culture.

Oh uh, uh, work's going great, great...  Great. 
In -- in fact, just the other day...
Clients pay the bills, heh, heh heh...  Of course I meet with them...
Well at least our clients want to see me. 
Ha ha, let's not turn this into an advertising meeting, okay?
Well at least Maria actually wants to see me.
Heh heh, well, anyway...
Oh, that brass bull, it's a gift from my business contact in Barcelona --

Grace, I've always had to be the one to make the right choices for you!  
You can't do it, I've always had to be the one.
You never listen to me!  You don't believe anything I say!  You just don't listen.
You hide things from me!  You're so distant!  You...
You do, you hide things from me!
Grace, I do one little thing wrong, and you're cold and distant!  Just one thing wrong, that's all it takes!
I try to reach out to you, I try to be romantic with you, but you're cold, and distant!  I do, I really try!
You're always choosing other things, you never choose me!  
Always choosing other things over me.
You like it when other people reach out to you, but you reject me!  
Always other people, other things, never me.
Grace, don't say you're going to remove our wedding picture... You are so cruel, do you know that?  So cruel.
Grace, don't say you're going to remove my italy picture... You are so cruel, do you know that?  So cruel.
I like my advice ball...  It's just this little thing I like, but you reject it!  You hate it because I like it!
When are you going to realize that art is not a career!  Is that ever going to sink in for you?
You claim to like paintings, and art, and all that bullshit...  But taking a couple of art classes in college does not make you an artist!
I hate our goddamn parties, I hate the people, especially all those fricking artists you keep inviting over!
It's obvious why you keep redecorating -- you're spoiled, you could never live without all this stuff!  That's why you redecorate!
You don't redecorate because you're into art or some bullshit like that... It's because you can't live without this stuff!  You're spoiled and you can't admit it!
You're never satisfied with anything!  You're never happy, never ever satisfied with anything.
You have no reason to be unhappy about this apartment, about anything!  Other than the fact that you're just never happy!
I like my fancy drinks, okay?  I like the good things in life, does that make me a bad person?  Their just drinks!
You think you're better than me just because I didn't come from a rich background!  You do, I know it, you think you're better than me!
I like my advice ball, it's just a little thing I like, but you look down on it, like it's some sort of low class piece of shit!
What is everybody hinting at?  I think cheating is wrong!  It's wrong!  What are you all hinting at?
What is everybody hinting at?  That I'm a bad person?  That I don't love my wife?  What?
Okay, look, if you're trying to ask about our sex life, it's great, okay?  Fabulous!  Exhilarating sex every night, happy?
Grace doesn't want to go to therapy, okay?  I've tried, she refuses to go!  She won't go.
You're trying to say we've got problems, huh?  That something is wrong with our marriage?  
You're saying we've got problems.
Grace, I -- I just want to be together, and be happy, can you just see that?  
Can't we just do that?
Uh huh, you...
Oh, yeah, you...
Yeah, 
I know what you'll say...
I can guess what you're about to say...
I know what you're about to say...
Yeah, yeah...
You've been sucking up to Grace all evening!
You've been criticizing me ever since you got here!
You've been flirting with Grace all evening!
With your damn kissing, and flirting, Christ!
You've been trying to calm us down all evening!
The way you keep trying to be so supportive!
All your goddamn over analytical explanations...!
You're so damn positive tonight, it's annoying as hell!
You're so negative tonight, uhh!!
You're so quiet tonight, God...
You're so uncooperative, Jesus...
You keep cussing, it's not what I need to hear, you know?
You and your praise for Grace...
The way you criticize me... Jesus...
The way you flirt in front of my face...
The fact you kiss Grace right in front of me... God...
How you keep trying to keep us calm...
How you keep trying to be so supportive...
The way you want to explain everything to us...
You're goddamn obsessed with marriage, Christ!
You keep talking about divorce, you're driving me insane!
You can't stop talking about sex, Jesus!
You can't stop talking about cheating!  Jesus!
The way you can't stop talking about therapy!  Goddamn!
You keep bringing up the goddamn wedding picture, Christ!
Enough already about fricking italy!
Quit harping on my advice ball already!
Just quit harping on my little brass bull, please!
Your just obsessed with the apartment and the decorating, goddamn!
You're totally obsessed with the painting, god!
You can't stop talking about drinks, just lay off already!
You can't stop talking about those goddamn sculptures, Christ!
You're obsessed or something about the view, God!
The way you keep bringing up marriage, uhh.
How you keep bringing up divorce, goddamn.
With all your goddamn references to sex, Christ.
The way you bring up infidelity, goddamn!
How you keep bringing up therapy, damn!
How you keep talking about the goddamn wedding picture.
The way you keep talking about italy, damn.
How you keep bringing up my little advice ball, God.
The way you obsess about my little brass bull, Jesus.
How you can't stop talking about the apartment and the decorating, Jesus.
How you keep talking about the damn painting, Christ!
You're always talking about drinks and stuff, God.
How you can't stop talking about Grace's goddamn sculptures, uhh.
You keep talking about the goddamn view, Christ.
How I'm...
How I'm not...
How I should...
How I shouldn't...
make art...
quit my job...
kill my wife...

kill myself...
How Grace...
How I...
Something about Grace's damn parents...
Something about my damn parents...
Something about Maria...
Something about 'Vince'...?
Grace --
Okay, you know what,  
Alright, you know what,  
I'm going to ask you something.
I need to ask you something.
Grace, let me ask our friend a question.
Grace, let me ask our guest a question.
What?
Yes or no.
Yes?
No?
If one person in a marriage gives the other advice, and that advice is taken -- years later, can you get blamed for that?
Is it okay to get blamed for giving advice that was taken, like, ten years ago?  
Shouldn't both people in a marriage _want_ the same things?
I'm saying, if you're married, each person should basically want the same things, right?  
Isn't marriage supposed to be the most important thing in your life?
I mean, marriage is supposed to be the most important, meaningful thing in your life, right?
Is it right for one person in a marriage to bring things up from the past that the other really just wants to forget?
I mean, if one person wants to forget some painful things from the past, shouldn't their spouse just let them?
When you're married, can you try to change the other person to be even 'better' than who yourself are?
Is it okay to try to quote-unquote 'improve' your spouse, even if you need that same improvement yourself?
Isn't the goal in life, and in marriage, to improve your life, to have more than you did before?
I mean, shouldn't you get married so you can have a better, richer life than before?
Marriage is about saying yes to the other person, even if you're not sure about it, right?
I mean, if your husband or wife reaches out to you, you have to reach back, right?
A person in a marriage should _believe it_ when one tells the other how they feel about them, right?
I mean, when you're married, you should trust what the other person says they feel about you, right?
It's okay for a married... person, to talk and be friendly with someone of the opposite sex, right?
I mean, come on, if you're married, a little bit of harmless flirting and joking around is allowed, am I right?
Each person in a marriage is supposed to try really hard to be _in sync_ with the other, right?
I mean, when you're married, to make it good, you need to always be positive, and agreeable, and _together_, right?
What...?!
Oh, okay... sure...
Oh, alright... yeah...
Oh, yeah, that's fine... that's fine...
Look, you don't need answer, I don't need to hear anymore!
Look, don't bother answering, I don't need to hear it!
Uhh, I keep trying to help you Grace, but you reject me, you cut me off, you cut me out of your life, goddammit!
Uhh, I try so hard to reach out to you, Grace, and you reject me!  You're cold!  You're distant!  I can't keep going this way, it's killing me!
Uhh, Grace, you think that if I hadn't 'convinced you' not go into art, that you'd be totally happy!  The truth is, I saved you from that goddammit!  
Grace, you won't let me be who I want to be!  Who -- who I am!  This is who I am now!  Goddammit!
Uhh, Grace, you keep looking for something to satisfy you -- but that's what I'm supposed to be!  I'm supposed to be the most important thing, and I'm not, goddammit!
Uhh, Grace, you think I'm some kind of shallow person, obsessed with money, that I don't love you!  You think our marriage is all just a sham!
Uhh, You think you're better than me, Grace!  You had this rich upbringing... and now you look down on me!  How am I supposed to be happy like that Grace?  Goddammit!
Uhh, Grace, I love you, you're my wife, I love you, and you... are accusing me of... I don't know what, what are you accusing me of?  I love you, don't you know that?!
Uhh, look, it's obvious we're not happy, Grace! I'm not happy, you're not happy, and no matter how much I try, I can't make us happy! I don't know what to do, goddammit!
Uhh, Grace, any time I talk about our wedding, or our engagement, you hate it, hate it!  How do you think that makes me feel?  What am I supposed to think, Grace?
can you believe this?
I...
Uhh! What?
Oh, god...!
Oh, Christ...!
Oh, Jesus...!
Oh, come on...!
no, I'm not fixing you a drink right now!
wait, I can't fix you a drink right now!
Uhh!  Yeah, go on, get away from me!
Yeah, go on, get out of my face! 
I can't even frigging look at you.
I can't stand frigging looking at you!
I can't frigging take this!
Uhh!  You are cruel.
Uhh!  You are heartless.
Uhh!  You are uncaring.
Just stay away from me.
Don't talk to me.
Uhh!  Wait, you're walking away?  
Uhh!  You're walking away?  
You can't just walk away!
Don't just say that and then walk away!
Goddammit, Grace!
Oh...  Shit!
What the... goddammit!
Uhh... goddammit, Grace...
Uhh... shit...
Uhh... what the... goddammit...
Oh... uhh...
this has never ever happened before...!
this is not normal, this has never happened.
I can't believe this is happening...!
uhh...
Look, if -- if you want to go, just...
Look, you -- you probably want to get out of here...
Look, if you -- if you need to go, you know...
Oh, Jesus... Christ...
this has never ever happened before...!
this is not normal, this has never happened.
I can't believe this is happening...!
uhh...
Look, if you want to go, just...
Look, uhh... you probably want to get out of here...
Look, if -- if you need to go, you know...
Oh, Jesus... Christ...
What? I can't hear a goddamn word you're saying!
What? I can't hear you!
I'm not!
I didn't say anything!
No, look -- look, just, uhh, leave me alone for a second, okay?
No, don't -- don't come over here, alright?
What, are you -- are you leaving?  Now?
Wait, you're leaving? Now?
Hey, hey -- hey, no, I -- I don't...
No, d -- d -- don't, come on...
What?  uhh... w -- what are you saying?
What are you saying?  What?
What?!  What are you saying to me?
What are you saying to me?!  W -- what?
Uhh... 
I...
Uhh... 
that's...
Oh, so now you're criticizing me?
Ah, okay, you're criticizing me now!
H -- hey, no, uhh... no, w -- w -- what are you doing?
What, no, no, hey, c -- c -- come on...!
Hey, don't -- don't, c -- come on, come on!
Uhh, no, uhh... don't -- don't do that!
Wait, what, are you trying to explain this to me?
Hold on, wait, what, y -- you're trying to explain this to me?
Grace, what the hell are you saying about me in there?
What? Are you talking about me in there?
Grace, are you talking about me?
No!
What's it to you?
I was not talking to you!
What?
Uhh...
This is insane!  Oh, so, your broken dreams are my goddamn fault?  
Ah, you disagree, thank you, that should help Grace!
Grace, I did not stop you from becoming an artist!
I'm trying to help you get your life together!
Thank you.  Grace, you wanted a real job -- at the time, you told me you didn't want to paint anymore!  You said that!
That's bullshit.
Grace, even though you're now a creative director at work, 
and even though you redecorate the apartment all the time,
the truth is... you're not an artist.
I'm sorry, you're not.
Sometimes I think about that time you took me to an art gallery in college... 
Ah, see, just you saying even that helps...
You know... that was the happiest I can ever remember seeing you, Grace.
Ah, that was a long time ago.
you're saying I'm... controlling?
You can't put that on me.
Oh my God... 
uhh...
Oh, okay, all of this, our life, it's all... it's all just been a waste...! 
No, Grace, you have not wasted ten years.
Grace, come on, how can you say that?  
These last ten years have not been a waste...
Uhh...
What? Grace, I'm not stopping you from doing anything!  
Besides, you never listen to me anyway.
No, see, Grace, you're the one who can't stop obsessing about how you 'could've been an artist'.  
It's not me.
What? No...
See, what I've tried to do, 
is help Grace somehow get over her art problem.
What?  Oh, Jesus...
Ah ha, ha ha ha, ha, yeah, heh...
No, Grace, see, the only problem I have with art is how you've wasted so much time obsessing about it...!  
Heh, ha ha!
What? 
Oh, Christ... 
uhh...
no, don't let her trick you.  
She's just trying to make you feel all sympathetic and shit.
Thank you, you disagree, that helps us!
Grace, see, you've twisted this all up, and you're acting like your whole goddamn life is over already!
Huh?
this is about Grace, not me.
See, what aches are my goddamn ears, listening to this new age crap you're spouting!
What?!  Oh, Christ...  Where did you get that from?
Uhh...!
Uhh, see this is so typical of you Grace, telling me I have a problem, when it's you...
No no no, no, see, I -- I can tell, Grace, you're afraid of something here... trying to use me as an excuse...
No, I think you are afraid of something...
Ah, you disagree, good, that can only help her...
God, Grace, if you love art so much, why can't you just do painting on the side, on the weekends or something?
Are -- are you saying I'm afraid of something?  
Ahh! Ho ho... you -- heh -- uhh...
See, once again, Grace, you're blaming me for your problems!
Heh, scared of art... ha... ah, heh, I've -- I've never heard of something so.. heh... ridiculous...
Actually I think therapy could cure Grace of her obsession with being an artist -- 
and we could stop wasting our time and money on all this redecorating!  
Uhh, finally, somebody to back me up -- that helps us!
Why don't you just do it then?  
Be a goddamn artist already.  What are you afraid of, Grace?  
Ah, yes, just you saying that should really help her...
What - what are you talking about?  
You can't do that! 
Grace, quitting your job would be the stupidest thing you could possibly do...
Grace, no, come on, don't even -- don't even talk like that.
See, I don't think you really want to be an artist.  
This is all just something for you to blame me for.
See, I don't think you really could be an artist if you wanted to.  You can't do it.
See, I don't think you really want to be an artist.  
I've been right all along.
you're saying I'm lying?
What?  Oh, Jesus...! 
that's what you think too?
do you agree with that?
do you agree with that crap?
you -- you think I'm lying?  
Thank you, just saying that should help us!
Grace, I was trying to help you -- and you gladly took my advice!
I never said such a thing, you're completely making that up!
Thank you, saying that might just help her understand!
Anyhow, it's true -- if you really wanted to paint art, which I don't think you do, 
you could do it on the weekends, instead of obsessively redecorating our apartment.
I -- 
Uhh...
Uhh, I -- Grace, I don't remember what I said.
Uhh, heh... Grace, I... I -- I just don't see the point of painting...
See, Grace, you're the one turning this into such a big issue.  
In fact I saved you from wasting your life as an artist.
Uhh, okay, look, if I didn't save you, I definitely helped you... 
And at the time, you were happy for that!
You are just unable to accept that you're not an artist!
uhh...
I still say advertising is the best thing for you.  
What?  
Uhh...
Uhh...
I don't care what you say, I know I'm right...
What?
you're saying I'm to blame?
What?  Oh, Jesus Christ...
that's what you think?
is that true, all of this is my fault?
Holy shit... you think I'm to blame... I'm to blame for all this... 
Ah, you disagree, thank you, that helps us!
Grace, I didn't trick you, I helped you, and you wanted my help, you needed it, remember?
Your art career...?
Ah, you disagree with Grace, that might help her...
Sometimes I wish you were a goddamn artist, so you could see what that life would really be like!
I don't hate -- it's not like... I... I -- uhh...
I, I...  I -- I don't know what to say.
Painting, uh, just, uh, seems so pointless, what do you possibly expect to gain from it?
you're saying I'm... depressed?
You know what's sad... 
all this wasted time and energy I've spent trying convince you that you didn't 'give up art'...
It's pathetic really.
Oh, Jesus.
Look, I can't talk about 'art' anymore, it's so draining...
What? 
Uhh! 
uhh...
Ah, you disagree, thank you, that helps us!
You can be angry, Grace, but don't be angry at me!
You're angry?! I -- it -- it's statements like this that make me furious!! 
What?
You're so angry, but you don't do anything about it, except bitch and moan!
You've always been angry about something, Grace... if it's not one thing, it's another...
See, 
Grace will tell you she's 'angry', but the truth is, there's no reason for it!
Uhh, look, don't give me your touchy-feely bullshit, I can't do anything with that.
I mean, Grace, it's so ridiculous to get angry about this art stuff, that you wisely stopped wasting your time with a long time ago.
Oh, God...
you're saying I'm... angry?
You know what makes me so angry?  
How you've so conveniently forgotten how much you used to actually hate painting!
Ah, thank you, just saying that helps us!
It's true!  She wanted to give up painting, and it makes me so angry that she pretends otherwise!
No, what really makes me angry is how fricking miserable I know you'd be if you actually were a so-called 'artist'.
No, it's true, she's right, it's totally annoying!  
God... it makes me so angry.  
did I ever tell you how she humiliated me at a gallery in front of her 'artist' friends?
Ah, see, just you saying that helps me!
see, I made some comment, and Grace told everybody that I knew nothing about art... uhh...
N -- n -- no, no I don't want to make art.  Please.
Look, I could paint if I wanted to, but I don't.  Jesus.
What?
Oh, Christ... give me a break...
You've got quite an imagination, Grace.
Painting... Grace, why do you make up stuff like this, just to piss me off?
Grace... 
Jesus...! 
Ah, good, you're trying understand this craziness -- that might help her! 
There's nothing wrong with the stupid painting! 
No, look, there's nothing wrong with the stupid painting! 
Uhh... you feel that for no reason! 
No, no, you're ignoring what the client wants, Grace! 
I'm the project manager, it's my job to keep you under control! 
That's for sure! 
Vince?  Vince who?  Who is Vince? 
No, this is crazy talk, you're making no sense.  Forget this. 
Oh give me a break!  They spoiled you! 
No, your parents are generous, successful, respectable -- 
No, look, Grace, your parents are generous, successful, respectable -- 
Oh Christ. 
They're vacations! Expensive ones at that!
Ah, you want to know more. Thank you, that helps her.
Grace, you never want to go on vacation with me and your parents - so I have to plan everything!
Oh, now it's all my fault. Just because your parents and I get along, now it's some big conspiracy.  
look around this apartment. It's got everything anyone would ever want. But, Grace, oh no, she's never satisfied. 
Grace, after your upbringing you have the nerve to say that --
What?
Well, heh, I -- I mean, we -- heh -- we -- we've got everything...
Grace, come on, look around. We've got a great life. 
Grace, it's very important to keep the wine at --
Yeah. Life is passing me by. Give me a break. 
Grace! What are you saying? 
What!? Grace, I'm right here. I'm the -- I'm the same person I've...  I've... always been...
God Grace, the only thing you should be afraid of is misplacing your credit cards...  heh... heh... 
You know, heh... whenever we go to visit Grace's parents, she gets all stressed out. 
She says she's afraid to visit....  I don't get it... her family is fabulous! The best!
Grace!
But, Grace... Uhh.
Oh, so I'm afraid now. Jesus.
Afraid of my parents?! My parents are idiots. 
What!? That's ridiculous. Why would I -- why would I be afraid of their stupid meatloafs and their tacky house and their crappy wine...?
See Grace, that's ridiculous. The only thing I'm afraid of is their bad taste might rub off on us... ha ha!
I -- I -- I can't believe you think I'm... I'm... afraid...
What are you talking about? You're always buying stuff...
Uhh... wha -- what?  I just -- I just like to own the finest, that's all!
See Grace, as usual you're making something out of nothing...
Grace, maybe a therapist could help us figure out why we always fight about visiting my parents. 
No, you're the one who always turns it into a big scene!
Ah, thank you, that helps us. 
Grace, I -- I'm just trying to... Uhh.
What the!?  Uhh...  you think I should quit my job?
What are you talking about? You want us to live on the street or something?
You're both crazy!
What is there to know? Quit your job, the next thing you're eating out of a garbage can. 
Whew!  Whew.  See Grace, that's a crazy idea.
Grace, I don't think you really do want us to quit our jobs, lead a simpler lifestyle. 
Oh come on! You grew up with a silver spoon in your mouth. You can't live any other way. 
you think I'm... lying?
You think I'm not good enough...!
What... what -- n -- no... I, I -- I mean...
Yeah, I -- I have good taste...!  I know about... mmm... wines... and stuff!
Grace, when we first got together you told me you dreamed of having your own fancy apartment...
High culture, best of everything... This is what you wanted!
Well, heh, Grace, I, I -- I mean, heh, you practically told me...!
Well, I, I -- I mean, you -- you must want this...!
you -- you're saying I'm ... to blame?
Like your parents, you mean!
Thank you, you disagree. That helps her. 
Ah, you want to know more. That helps her. 
Oh, I see.  I'm the bastard here.  Ruining poor Grace's life. 
Bullshit!
Grace, you always blame me...
Jesus, what do you want! Now you're unhappy because we're too well off?
isn't it -- isn't that ridiculous? 
Well, I mean, Grace, what do you want?
Look around here. We're doing well, really well.
Oh yeah, you'd never admit that I've created a good life for us.
Well, I -- I mean, this place, it...  it -- it's everyone's dream, right?
See Grace. Our friend knows a good life when he sees it. 
See Grace. Our friend knows a good life when she sees it. 
Grace, how can you say --
Jesus, Grace, most women would consider themselves lucky. 
I tried to give Grace the best during our Italy vacation. The best hotels, the best food...
Ugh!
What!? I -- I mean, why travel if you can't...  do it in style...
See Grace?  There's no problem.
Yeah, they were horribly abusive.  They bought her whatever she wanted.  Those monsters.
Grace, you can't blame everything on them...
thank you, that helps her. 
Oh, Grace, it's always the same...  
Yeah, real tacky. 
Grace has always enjoyed slumming.  That's why she likes visiting them. 
Well, I -- I mean, all -- alright... my parents aren't all bad...
See Grace? Even our friend thinks they're tacky. 
Grace, don't, no, you don't need to --
Stop it, stop it!  
Grace, we don't -- we don't have to do this... things are okay, we can just --
No, Grace, we can... I mean, come on, don't make it out to be so bad...
don't - don't believe that...!  That's not how she felt...!
No, Grace, of course you were happy...  We were both very happy...!
I -- I remember, I'm sure I remember!
Grace, c'mon, we can go back to the way it was when we started out, we were happy...!
Y - y... yes!
yes!
But... wait!  No, I -- I'm positive we were happy when we got married...!
Uhh, Grace, come on, don't change the past!
Grace, I -- I want to take care of you... 
You've always wanted that, I know you did...
Grace...
No, 
I -- I know, deep down, Gr -- Grace and I... 
Heh... I mean... I -- I just think back to that Christmas Eve I proposed to her...
Ah, good, you want to know more too, see, that helps us...
'Care' for me?
No, that -- that's good, that question might help her...
See, 
this goes way back... all the way back to college...
No, 
don't listen to all this, I, I... I, I... I know, Grace and I, we're... okay...
It's just that Grace can never seem to... you know, actually say that...
What, I mean, 
you think I've -- uhh... I, I -- I've -- I've done something wrong... I mean... heh... uhh...
But, no, really, I'm a very caring, and romantic person... 
she's got no reason to feel this way.
Ah, good, well... well, what you're saying should help her...
No, Grace, c'mon...  I'm here... I'm here for you, goddammit...!
You know, Grace, ever since I first proposed to you, almost ten years ago now...
it's always been impossible to get you to just... just... feel happy...!
Ah, good, you're -- you're trying to understand, see, that helps... that helps us...
No, I mean, I'm sure that Grace really... loves me... but -- uhh -- uhh...
So yeah, I think we just need to realize that, that's all...
you're -- you're saying I'm... I'm a loving person.
Grace, you know I've never wanted anyone but you...
N -- no...!
I, I -- I mean, no... heh...
you're saying I don't... communicate?
What, I'm not allowed to be angry?
I'm not telling her what to do, I'm trying to help her!
Uhh...
See, I'm the one trying to reach out to you, Grace...
No, wait a minute, I reach out to Grace, I really do...!
I try to be open, and honest... you know...
What...?  I, I -- I'm hold -- I'm holding...?
See, Grace, I feel like it's you that's not reaching out.
Grace...!
we... uhh...
Of course your friends are jealous, they should be, you've got a great life!
Jesus, Grace... 
that's...
Grace, how can you feel that way, I, I -- I mean, we met in college, we got engaged!  uhh...
No, 
this is not about 'college'... I -- I think Grace is just stressed out from work or something...
you know, it's weird to me, when I'm on a business trip, Grace never calls me, ever!
She says she's afraid to call me!
Uh, what?!  I, I -- I, I mean, why, is -- is it something I'm... uhh...
Well how do you think that makes me feel?
Uhh, 
I knew you'd say I was afraid of something...  God...
What, Grace, I'm afraid of, what... commitment or something?  Is that what you think?
No, see, I was ready to propose to Grace right from the start, and I did it!
See, I knew I was going to marry Grace from the moment we met!
Oh, I'm afraid?
that's -- uhh...  That's what it is, huh?
Uhh, Christ... this is bullshit...
This is such bullshit.
What, I'm -- I'm afraid that, what... she doesn't trust me or something?  Heh...
O -- okay, okay... y -- well, you know, well, you're saying Grace doesn't trust me... uhh... okay... 
Of course Grace trusts me, why wouldn't she...
Wait, wait -- are you saying we should get divorced?
This is bullshit...!
you're saying it's over, we should just give up...?! 
God, I, I -- I mean, to even suggest divorce is... 
Look I'll just forget you said that.
S -- separate?  Why -- w -- w -- why would we separate?
Wait, wait -- are you saying we should separate?
God, I mean, to even suggest separating is... 
Look we'll just forget you said that.
Huh!
See, Grace is actually the one who has been resisting that idea... 
You know, I can't say Grace never acts loving towards me...
She's all over me at our goddamn parties, trying to look good in front of the guests!
Ah, thank you, just saying that helps us...
See, 
her acting loving is the only reason I like our stupid parties.
Uhh...
Heh... you know, the worst is when I come home from a business trip...
Grace avoids me for days!
Ah, good, you, well -- you want to understand, see, that helps me...
See, it's not like I don't try to call her when I'm gone... she doesn't pick up the phone...
Heh heh, I mean, heh I don't get it!
See, Grace, you exaggerate, you pretend you're more unhappy than you actually are, just to make things seem worse!
You're saying I'm lying?
Heh -- what?  Oh ho, God...!
you think something's 'going on'?
you, you -- you, what -- you think I'm lying...?!
No, Grace, nothing is 'going on', okay?!  Christ...
Grace, no --
Grace, what are you talking about, 'mistake you made'... what -- what 'mistake'?  
Are you just making stuff up now?
you think this is all my fault, don't you?
You're saying I -- I caused all this?  I, I what, what -- what screwed up somewhere along the line?
Holy shit... you think I'm to blame... I'm to blame for all this...!
Oh, well thank God you disagree, that helps!
I didn't screw anything up...
D -- divorce?  
you think we should get a divorce?
Wait -- s -- separate?  You think we should separate?
This is bullshit... 
Okay, wait, so now you're trying to tell me I'm... depressed?
Well, 
I've felt incredibly alone... uhh... that's for goddamn sure. 
I mean... I'm hating life right now, but uh... I don't know if I'm depressed!
Look, you're doing it again, you're putting all this on me...
What...?
Oh my God... 
what... uhh...
Ah, you disagree, thank you, you just saying that helps us...
See, Grace, you twist it into something bad!  It's so typical!
Grace, I'm not 'acting' when I'm being romantic... God damn...!
Grace, I know you're angry, but come on, don't... 
It's so annoying... Grace, why is it that anytime I want to do something nice for you, you resist it?
Like I always have to convince you?
Ah, thank you, just saying that helps!
Oh, Christ.
It's just never easy with you, Grace, and it wears me down.
you're saying I'm... angry?
It's so annoying... you know, Grace, with our trip to Italy, I was trying so hard...
she makes it so difficult...
It's so annoying... you know lately I've been really trying to spend more time together...
Ah, well good, ah, good, you want to understand, see, that helps me...
See, I'm trying to fix what's wrong, Grace...
Uhh...
I really appreciate you saying that, that helps us...
let's just say sex has never been a fun topic for us. 
Kids?  You -- you don't think we should have kids?
Heh, hey... heh heh heh, hey, no no no, don't -- don't try to... don't -- don't to try accuse me of -- of -- of anything with Maria... 
No -- no, no, Grace, don't, don't even about think that -- look, look --
look, our -- our 'friend' has just gone too far this time, that's all that's happening here...! 
What?!  There's nothing to... uhh! 
No no, there's nothing to... uhh... 
Vince?  Who is this Vince? 
What is...?  This is making no sense... 
What?  What is this?  I'm confused. 
What?! 
That's, that's -- that's what you think?! 
What?!  Are -- are you trying to say... I might not love Grace?! 
Jesus, I -- is that... that's what you think is going on here?! 
Jesus, uhh, I think you're taking back what you said, at least...  
Jesus, no, to even think that I might not love Grace is... is really... too much!!
Marriage, well... heh... you know, it's sad, or maybe funny, I... uhh... I always thought marriage would be easy! 
Yeah, I always thought marriage was supposed be this great thing that you'd just be happy and... and... 
and... well, happy...  or at least just easier than this! 
Ah, no, look, believe me, I now know marriage can really suck, in the worst way... 
No, look, it's now painfully obvious to me I didn't know jack about what marriage was really like... 
Grace, no... 
Uhh, what? 
No, no, look, marriage is -- uhh... is this great thing that everybody does, to be happy!  It can turn out just fine! 
Uhh -- and now? 
Grace...! 
Right, maybe if she... uhh... tells us the answer, it will help her confusion, heh! 
No...  
No no no, this is just crazy talk, this is crazy talk, just stop it! 
Divorce?  Don't talk about divorce!  
Can't you see how harmful it is to even bring that up right now?! 
What the hell are you -- 
Oh my God!  
Okay, look, let's talk about things that will help us here, okay?  Thank you. 
Yes, good, that should help her, we need clear this up, although I'm not sure I want to hear the answer! 
Really? 
Oh God, this is so depressing...  
Oh Jesus, look, I'm not going to talk about sex... 
Or our lack thereof... 
Well, actually, it will make me feel better to just say, I've tried to make it happen, but, with no luck... 
Oh, uhh, okay. 
What? 
Oh God, this is so depressing...!
What? 
Uhh, what the hell...! 
What the hell are we talking about here! 
This is ridiculous, stop it... 
No no, stop it, this is ridiculous, don't -- don't talk about this kind of thing, come on...!
No no, don't talk about... uhh... infidelity... come on... 
No, look, I, I -- we, uhh... we all know it's wrong... come on, we don't -- we don't have to... there's -- there's no... 
H -- hey, no, hey, uh, hey... c -- come on, Jesus...!    
What? 
Uhh... 
I, I -- I'm not -- there's -- there's nothing...  
No, you're -- look, you -- you're really -- you're really reading into things here, Grace...  
Look, Maria is just a very important... uhh... client, I, I, I -- I don't know what else to say -- 
Well, I guess you are, kind -- kind of... um... I, I, I, I mean, she, she -- she's the client, and, and you're... um.. 
There's... nothing... to... understand... heh heh... 
Look, I -- no, I'm, uh, I'm, uh -- I'm trying to tell you, there's nothing... Maria... there's nothing... 
Come on, 
does it look like I want to fix you drinks right now?
come on, I don't feel like fixing drinks at this moment!
are you implying I... could be seen as controlling?  Uhh... no... 
you're saying... I'm not a loving person?  Uhh... no... 
are you imagining I'm somehow... not communicative? 
are you implying I... I could be afraid? 
I'm not depressed?  W -- what are you saying...
you're saying I'm... not angry?  Uhh... yeah... 
Pets?  You think we should have pets? 
you're saying I'm... not depressing?
Right, I've been trying to stay as positive as I can through all this! 
you're saying I'm... depressing?
That's crazy!  All through this I've been trying to be as optimistic as I can! 
you're saying we... should not have sex? 
Been there, done that... I don't recommend it... 
Jesus, what the hell are you talking about?!  That makes no sense! 
What?! Where did that come from?  You're not making sense! 
What?!  Who the hell is Vince?  Stop talking nonsense! 
What?!  That makes no sense! 
No, uhh... 
what I need is to figure out what hell is going here... 
we just need to get this all under control, that's what we need... 
Look, just quit taking sides, it's going to do more harm than good! 
Look, quit taking sides already, it's just going to make it worse! 
Hey, no, it's just going to make this whole thing even worse if you keep criticizing me! 
No don't criticize me anymore, it's just going to turn this even more ugly! 
Look, just quit the flirting right now, I'm warning you! 
Look, quit the flirting already, I'm not going to put up with that at this point! 
Uhh,  
we went over that already, didn't we?
Uhh,  
we already talked about that, am I wrong?
Jesus,  
we've already talked about that, alright? 
Christ,  
haven't we already talked about that?
Oh, Jesus Christ,  
would just quit it with that?  Uhh!
Oh, God,  
would you stop it with that stuff already? 
Jesus,  
why do you keep bringing that same topic up? 
Christ,  
you keep bringing that same topic up, you know that?  
Jesus,  
you keep obsessing about Grace's stuff, you know that?  
Christ,  
can we possibly talk any more about Grace's stuff tonight?  
we've heard enough praise! 
no more praise, please! 
quit it with that stuff! 
stop it with the criticism!

that all that is supposed to help me understand something about myself?
that I'm supposed to realize something about myself from all that?
that we'll somehow realize something about our marriage?
that all that is supposed to help us realize something about us?

No,

Don't run away!
Get back here!  Yes or no?
Don't try to hide!
Yes...!
Grace!
Bullshit.
You've been secretly painting?  When --
Jesus --
Grace, I know you want to be an artist.
But I could never be married to you if you were.  
I can't... I -- I just can't...
When I married you, see, I was sure I could convince you to give it up, to -- to go into advertising.
And -- and I did it, and it worked.
But now... I -- I don't know, Grace...
I don't know...
You let me --
uhh...
Dominate you...?  What?  I don't --
But Grace --
Oh, come on, don't --
Jesus...
Grace... 
I'm -- I'm just... af -- afraid of... of being poor.
It never feels like enough!
As a kid... it -- it was...
My family was always on the edge.
We even spent six months in a shelter once. 
All of this stuff...
Is a kind of protection from that ever happening again.  
Grace...
See... 
I'm... 
ashamed of my parents. 
I know, I know. But compared to yours... they're so ... ignorant.
I've tried hard to be like your family --
But I feel like a phony.
I feel like I can never get rid of my past.
It's kind of like I don't know who I am anymore.
uhh...
What?!
An art major named Vince --
Y -- y -- you what?
Uhh... huhh... ho... wow... uhh...
Uhh... I'm glad you finally told me.
Grace...
uhh...
I've been having an affair.
It's over now, though.
with the client, in, uh, Barcelona.
I was lonely, Grace.
But, but, I -- I regret it, I really, really regret it.
I forced you to marry me, didn't I.
When I proposed to you, in front of your parents, on Christmas Eve, and...
I knew you wouldn't be capable of saying no.
Yes.
uhh...
Jesus...!
I, uhh...
More?
Wait, 
Grace, there's more...
I --
What?!
I'm going to give you the truth too, Grace.
Jesus...!
I, uhh...
Again?!
Okay, 
Grace, I have one more thing to say...
This is too much!!!
I, uhh...
I, uhh...
Okay... look... heh heh...
All -- alright... look...  
We're... we're actually fine... everything's fine...
Everything's fine... we're -- we're not... uhh... we're fine.

You know, 
nothing's changed, we're fine...  we'll see you out.

And no you, you -- you don't have to be nice anymore, heh, we're -- we're fine...
And there's no need to disagree or criticize us anymore...  we're fine...
And there's no need to be rude anymore...  we're fine...
Come out from there!
No, no more need to be nice, okay?
No, n -- no more need to be difficult, okay?
No, no more need to be rude, okay?
Please come back out here!
Uh, look, we'll uh... we'll see you later, or, or -- or -- or whatever.
So, ah, we'll, uh, we'll -- I'll give you a buzz later, or, um, or something.
Alright, so, um, we'll, we'll, we'll -- we'll see you, at some point, stay in touch, alright?
Uh, come on, 
Uhh,

You were something else tonight!
I cannot believe this!
You really outdid yourself tonight!
Me?!  What the hell were you thinking!
What are you talking about?  You were worse than me!
I was trying to keep things sane, you were out of control!
That's bullshit!  You're so out of touch with reality it sickens me!
You're absolutely insane, you know that?  Where do you come up with this stuff?
You're out of your mind -- out of your goddamn mind!
Yeah... yeah.
It was nice to see you.
It's great you could come over... really...
Thanks for coming over... it, it -- it was fun.
Look, we're glad you came over, but w -- why don't you just go now.
Uh, it's great you came over, but it's time to call it a night.

Bye...
Night...
Uh, be safe, uh...
Take it easy...!
Yes, it does change everything.
I think it's over.
No!!
It's over, Grace, can't you see that?
I just told you something about me I should have said a long time ago
I can't be married to an artist.
and...
I'm afraid of being poor.
but...
I cheated on you.
I betrayed you.
No, Grace, this is about me.  I see now it's not about you, or about our marriage.
See, Grace, this is about me, as a person... and -- and about you as a person, but... 
but it's not about us, about our marriage.  I see that now...
I'm sorry.  You really helped me though, so, thanks.
This changes everything...

Please come back out here!
I just told you something about us I should have said a long time ago
You just told me something about us you should have said a long time ago
You've been using me as an excuse to not be an artist...
You think I'm phony for hating my parents, and wishing they were like yours.
I manipulated you into marrying me...
No, Grace, this isn't about you, or me, it's about us...
Our marriage.  I see that now.
I'm sorry.  Thank you, though, you really helped us.
Wha... I -- I just told you --
Grace, no, I... y -- you...
And about me...
No, Grace, this about me, and it's about us, but it's not about you...
Grace, I --
Not about me...?  Hey, no, wait!
This changes everything...
You... you really have to be an artist...
You... you're telling me I've controlled you.
You feel like you ruined everything from the start...
I prevented you from being an artist...
You think I'm a phony for despising my upbringing...
I manipulated you into marrying me...
I --
Look, we -- we need to talk...
Thanks for coming over, you... I think you helped us.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Bye.  Thanks.
And no,
