## Voice cloning
For the voice cloning with ElevenLabs, make sure the training samples are less than 11 MB. Check the [ElevenLabs documentation](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python) how the API works. 

To run the code, set up a virtual environment with the python packages specified in the requirements-voices.txt file.

### IMPORTANT
This code assumes the API key inside the code.
